# Kwasukela for Her Health

**Empowering African girls through storytelling, technology, and cultural wisdom.**

*Kwasukela for Her Health* is an offline, open-source platform designed to educate girls aged 9–18 about menstrual health, body literacy, and emotional well-being through the power of African stories.  
Rooted in culture and compassion, our goal is to bridge the health education gap in rural communities by combining storytelling, illustration, and mobile technology.

## Why It Matters

In many African communities, discussions around menstruation and puberty are limited by stigma, fear, and misinformation.  
*Kwasukela for Her Health* provides a safe, relatable, and joyful way for girls to understand their bodies and feel empowered.

Our stories are accessible offline and available in multiple South African languages.
